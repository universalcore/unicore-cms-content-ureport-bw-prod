The monthly money she earns helps her to pay up her school due arrears at the teacher\u2019s vocational school, her mum enrolled her in, but could not raise the required school dues. Lilian\u2019s mother is a single mother who has to raise six children on her own. With the meagre salary she receives from her teaching job at the government-supported school, Lilian\u2019s mother feels she cannot support her with anything more and that it is now up to Lilian to take charge of her life. However, Lilian is frustrated that her mother is abandoning her at a very critical stage. This situation reminds her of the time her father abandoned the family. Her mother has had to ensure they are educated; they have the basic necessities; food, shelter and proper treatment whenever sick. With limited options, Lilian has resorted to move in with her grandmother to avoid the constant battles and tension with her mother and seeking out her father\u2019s help is not an option. Lilian is certain that U-reporters will give her the right advice. Do you know someone in Lilian\u2019s situation? What advice would you give her? What advice would you give Lilian\u2019s mother?\r\n\r\n**Ur-Rights:**\r\nAdolescence (10 \u2013 19 years) is a time of transition involving many changes; biological, psychological and social. These changes occur at the same time and at different paces for each girl and boy. Girls generally face high risks and consequences at this time of their lives. Statistics show despite the introduction of Universal Primary and Universal Secondary education policies, 69 percent of older adolescent girls have not attended any school. A World Bank report, \u201cToolkit on Hygiene and Sanitation and Water in schools: Gender Roles and Impact 2005\u201d indicates that Girls who attend school, miss an average of 48 days in an academic year due to menstruation hygiene, meaning they lag behind in their studies. The report also indicates that the girl child lags behind the boy child in education by missing 4 days of school every month thereby missing 10% to 20% of her school days due to her menstrual period. It is also reported that 32 percent of adolescents experience some form of violence in school. The most common form of violence is sexual abuse of girls, including at school. Educated, healthy and skilled adolescent girls will help build a better future. The Education Act of 2008 provides for the Universal provision of pre-primary education as the first level of education, primary education (effected in 1997) and secondary education (post primary) (effected in 2007) education. To enrol in and pass primary school and complete secondary school education, Government provides; tuition, school based learning materials and school examination fees and has stated it will provide sanitary towels. In Government supported schools, segregated toilet facilities and washrooms should be availed for girls and children living with disabilities. Parents are expected to provide basic scholastic materials, stationery and contribute to school meals. To know more about your rights, click on\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026..\r\n\r\n 1.
